# Veri-GPT
VeriGPT-HDL is a prototype framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with simulation-based feedback loops to automatically generate, validate, and refine Verilog HDL code. It targets the automation of hardware design by incorporating formal verification principles and iterative correction mechanisms in a closed-loop system.
