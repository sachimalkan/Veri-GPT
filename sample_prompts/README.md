# Verilog Design Prompts

This folder contains 20 advanced Verilog design prompts. Each .txt file describes a digital design problem suitable for implementation in Verilog HDL.

## How to Use
- Use each prompt as a starting point to write your own HDL code.
- Ideal for interview prep, university assignments, or portfolio projects.
- Pair with corresponding modules in the 'verilog_combined_all' folder if needed.

## File Naming
Each prompt file is named as:
    <module_name>.txt

Example:
    alu_4bit.txt → Prompt for a 4-bit ALU
    fifo_8x8.txt → Prompt for a FIFO buffer

Happy Coding!
